Design Project:
"Design of Pesticide Residue Level Detection System for High-Value Crop using Deep Learning"

Abstract:
Cavendish banana is one of the Philippines' High-Value Crop and a top agricultural export generating millions of revenue for the country. To meet export demand, farmers intensify production, leading to increased pest issues and excessive pesticide use; primarily organophosphates like Chlorpyrifos. Thus, this often results in high pesticide residue levels, posing health risks and reducing export compliance with Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs). Current laboratory-based detection methods such as gas chromatography, take up to 20 working days, causing delays and potential losses. To address this, a deep learning-based detection system was developed to provide a faster, more efficient alternative. Among the evaluated models, EfficientNetB4 was selected through trade-off analysis. It achieved 95% accuracy in classifying residue levels (normal, high, critical), showing strong potential for real-time pesticide residue level screening in agricultural exports.
